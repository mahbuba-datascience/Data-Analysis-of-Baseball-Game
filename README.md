# Data-Analysis-of-Baseball-Game
Data Science Baseball Project

Objective:
The project on the sport of Baseball, which is a ball game played between two teams of nine on a
field with a diamond-shaped circuit of four bases. The vision of the project was to not only clean
the data using different types of statistics but also conclude on how age affects the overall ability
of a certain player. l
Plan of Action:
To accomplish this task, I divided up the tasks into certain goals. First, I needed to find a baseball
library which consisted of baseball data for a long period of time. Then I needed to analyze
different types of data that would allow us to properly conclude the age and overall ability of a
certain player correlation. Following this, I had to learn the different types of libraries and
functions in order to get the data that I wanted. Finally, I had to compile data together in order to
come up with the conclusion.
Required Libraries:
In order to accomplish this task I needed to import certain libraries such as seaborn, which is a
data visualization package that provides a high-level interface for drawing statistical graphics.
Additionally, it consists of the basic libraries such as pandas and numpy which allows us to make
datasets, arrays and sets. I also imported new libraries and functions such as warnings and math
which allowed us to do certain calculations.
Process of Project
I found a baseball library that had the statistics of all players and also teams and important
information that would allow us to make the best conclusion about the players with respect to
age and performance. Then I started parsing data into a dataframe that held all the data shown
below:

Then proceeded to produce an output of certain graphs by comparing certain numeric variables
in the dataset. For example, I explored the relationship between the total number of games
played vs the winning of a certain team.
At the same time, I was also able to produce bar chart graphs, for example to represent an earned
run average vs the opponent runs scored:

Some of the main factors in baseball are Batting, Pitching, Fielding and I was able to really dive
deep into the bits of certain aspects starting from creating graphs of how many runs were scored
in a specific year to outputting certain players with a specific physical stature such as height and
weight.
In the batting sector, there was lots of data such as singles, doubles, triples, home runs, batting
averages, home runs, etc. I was able to retrieve data of all the batters in the database and then
organize it with rank, year of playing and all their key stats through graphs and charts as shown
below:

When I was able to, I also parsed out data for the salaries of all the players and was able to see a
trendline about how the salary has changed over the years.
Since there are numerous positions in the sport of baseball, there are different salaries for
different positions on the field such as batter, pitcher, catcher, outfield, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd bases. I
was able to take the average salary of a certain position and then compare it to the ages of the
baseball players with different line charts shown below.
With salaries varying between different positions, it is very clear that one who makes mistakes
has repercussions, especially at such a high level. Hence, I calculated the error rate for each
position which allowed us to create a bar chart of position vs Error per game.

At the end of the day I was able to conclude and ask questions and see if it had a different
outcome. This allowed us to create certain scatter plots to see the batting average and just make
any other conclusions about age and performance.
Similar to the batting average, I was able to consider the same for the fielding percentage, which
allowed us to do the following:

Conclusion:
The project really involved a team and learning new ways to create multiple types of charts,
tables, graphs, and produce data in order to come to a reasonable conclusion for the Baseball
players and their ages. Using different libraries and different types of functions and statements
allowed us to create a new dataset that can be used in the future to predict playersâ€™ long run
performance with relation to age.
